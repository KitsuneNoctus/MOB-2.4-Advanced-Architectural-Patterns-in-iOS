## Learning Objectives (5 min)

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to...

1. Describe:
- the **xxxx** design pattern
- the software construction problem(s) it is intended to solve
- potential use cases for it (when to use it; when not to use it)
3. Assess:
- the suitability of a given design pattern to solve a given problem
- the trade offs (pros/cons) inherent in choosing high-level (MVC, MVVM, etc.) design patterns
4. Implement basic examples of MVVM explored in this class

### Reactive Programming

#### What it is

#### Why learn it

< general reason >

Problems solved by Rx
-

How Rx solves them



### Brief History

### RxSwift vs RxCocoa


### Problems solved and how xxxx


#### synchronous vs asynchronous



###  Basic Building blocks


#### Sequences



in RxSwift, everything is a sequence or something that works with a sequence.

#### Event Streams


Event streams (a sequence of events that happen over time).

But in RxSwift, Event Streams are called sequences.



#### Observables


And an Observable is just a sequence, with some special powers. One of these powers — in fact the most important one — is that it is asynchronous. Observables produce events, the process of which is referred to as emitting, over a period of time.
