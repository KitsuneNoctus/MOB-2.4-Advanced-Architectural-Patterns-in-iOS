## Why you should know this or industry application (optional) (5 min)

Design patterns represent time-tested solutions to general software development challenges realized by numerous experienced software engineers through decades of trial and error.

Design patterns...

- Create a common language
- Provide tested solutions
- Fast-track developer on-boarding
- Allow you to spot similarities between code

Itâ€™s best for a new developer to have an understanding of what they are before running into them...
