## Why you should know this...

<!-- Why Structural
- why these 2 patterns -->


## Learning Objectives (5 min)

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to...

1. Explain why **Structural design patterns** are important in software development
2. Describe:
- the **Adapter** and **Decorator** patterns
- the software construction problem each is intended to solve
- potential use cases for each (when to use them)
3. Assess:
- the suitability of a given design pattern to solve a given problem
- the trade offs (pros/cons) inherent in each
4. Implement basic examples of both patterns explored in this class


## Initial Exercise (15 min)

### Part 1 - Individually


<!-- Quiz location:

### Part 2 - In Pairs

Grade each other's quizzes, sharing answers, insights, etc.

## Overview/TT I (20 min)


### Structural Patterns
In software engineering, Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

Examples of Structural Patterns include:

- **Adapter**
- Aggregate
- Bridge
- Composite
- **Decorator**  
- Extensibility
- **Facade**
- Flyweight  
- Marker
- Pipes and filters
- Opaque pointer
- **Proxy**

*Lessons 1 and 2 cover the Creational design Patterns highlighted above*
