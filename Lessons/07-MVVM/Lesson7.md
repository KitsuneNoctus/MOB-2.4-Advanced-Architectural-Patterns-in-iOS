### Model-View-ViewModel

The MVVM pattern introduces a *fourth component* to MVC â€” the `View Model`.

The idea behind MVVM pattern is that `Views` with business logic specific to themselves will be backed by a `View Model` that represents the data for the `View`.

In MVVM, we implement *presentational business logic* - such as converting a Date into a date-formatted String - in the `ViewModel` *instead* of in the `View` or in the `Controller`.
