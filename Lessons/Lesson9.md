## Learning Objectives (5 min)

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to...

1. Describe:
- the **xxxx** design pattern
- the software construction problem(s) it is intended to solve
- potential use cases for it (when to use it; when not to use it)
3. Assess:
- the suitability of a given design pattern to solve a given problem
- the trade offs (pros/cons) inherent in choosing high-level (MVC, MVVM, etc.) design patterns
4. Implement basic examples of XXX explored in this class

## Overview/TT I (20 min)

###  Functional Programming

> “...functional programming is a programming paradigm… that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical
> functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.” – Wikipedia

#### Why Learn This?

**Enemy of the State** <sup>1</sup>
iOS and Mac apps rely heavily on state to change their presentation and respond to input &mdash; it's hard to imagine writing an app without the use of __*properties*__ and __*variables.*__

However, __*state is a huge source of needless complexity,*__ and __*responsible for most of the easily avoidable bugs*__ that users encounter.





- Why learn this?
- Industry examples of usage
- Best practices
- Personal anecdote

## In Class Activity I (30 min)

- I do, We do, You do
- Reading & Discussion Questions in small groups
- Draw a picture/diagram
- Complete Challenges solo or in pair
- Q&A about tutorials
- Pair up and code review
- Pair program
- Formative assessment
- Form into groups
- etc (get creative :D)

## Overview/TT II (optional) (20 min)

## In Class Activity II (optional) (30 min)

## Wrap Up (5 min)

- Continue working on your current tutorial
- Complete reading
- Complete challenges
