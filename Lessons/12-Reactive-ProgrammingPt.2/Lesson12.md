## Learning Objectives (5 min)

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to...

1. Describe:
<!-- - Reactive programming, ReactiveX (Rx), RxSwift & RxCocoa </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - history of Rx and the software problems it is intended to solve </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - benefits of Rx (how it solves challenges) </br>
- how to read Marble diagrams
- Basic Building blocks of Rx
- Basic operators
- Key concepts: Event Streams, Sequences, Observables (and their relationships), Subscribing
- The Lifecyce of Observables
2. Implement basic examples of:
- Observables -->

## Initial Exercise (15 min)

...continuation of Lesson 11 -> Activity 2 -> Exercise 3

**Questions?**
-

## Overview/TT I (20 min)

<!-- overview: Rx is Xx, y, and x (schedulers) -->

<!-- MORE on Observables -->

### Observables (continued...)

<!-- compare Notifications to Observables? -->

#### Ways to Create Observables
<!-- .create() method for Observables
.retry(3)
     .debug() -->

<!-- < TODO: Get examples -->

##
<!-- Hot and cold observables  -->


## In Class Activity I (10 min)

<!-- < TODO: observable exercises ??-->



## Overview/TT II (20 min)

### Subject

<!-- TODO: start with stating it is a Hot, then describe.  -->

<!-- TODO: give 2 progressive examples  -->


### Scheduler

<!-- TODO: show 2 scheduer examples - 1 from rx.playground -->


- $1


## In Class Activity II (30 min)

<!-- TODO: get exercises for subject  -->



## Overview/TT III (20 min)

### Operators

<!-- TODO: list the 4 types -->

<!-- TODO: pick a couple and show examples...esp. those that the class was confused by -->

<!-- TODO: end: You can create your own - show link  -->


## In Class Activity III (30 min)

<!-- TODO: get exercises for Operators  -->



## After Class

Research:

- Single, Completable, and Maybe (special types of Observables)


<!-- TODO: get an exercise for schedulers; 1st, review it in rx.playground, then do an exercise (convert something?) -->



## Wrap Up (5 min)
