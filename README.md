# MOB8-Advanced-Architectural-Patterns-in-iOS

## Course Overview

We will be exploring some Advanced features of Swift, some interesting architectural patterns that will help you build solid iOS apps.

## Objectives

- Learn about functional programming and how it can improve your programming skills
- Learn about Reactive programmming with RxSwift
- Functional reactive design patterns such as: Monads, Monoids, Functors, Applicatives

## Competencies

Students should be able to:

- Use functional programming methodologies in their projects.
- Design and implement complex app architectures using a functional design pattern.
- Compare and contrast functional design patterns with other design patterns(OOP etc).
- Understand Monads, Monoids, Functors, Applicatives
- Effectively use RxSwift and industry standard tools for functional reactive programming.
