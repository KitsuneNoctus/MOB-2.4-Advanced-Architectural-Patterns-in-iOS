## Course Description

We will be exploring some Advanced features of Swift as well as some interesting architectural patterns that will help you build rock solid iOS apps. We will review the architectural paradigms and then do a deep dive into a cutting edge iOS patterns like Functional Programming & Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).

## Class Assignments

### Tutorials
**[FILL IN]**

### Projects
**[FILL IN]**

**All projects will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class. 

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.


## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- No more than two no call no shows
- No more than four excused absences
- Make up all classwork from all absences
- Finish all required tutorials and projects
- Pass the final exam (summative assessment) with >=80%
